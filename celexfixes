How to fix BSOD:

a) Try turning off VBS / Hyper-V / Virtualisation, The way to check if you have it is by opening Task Manager, Go to "Performance" at the top, Press "CPU", In the bottom right it should say "Virtualisation", If its on google how to turn off virtualisation on your motherboard.

b) Restart your computer and press the "Delete" key constantly until you see your bios load up, There should be a search bar somewhere, If not you're gonna have to find the toggle to turn off secure boot manually, Every motherboard and cpu have a different BIOS so there is no way to know exactly where its gonna be on everybodys BIOS but once you find it you need to turn off secure boot, Then find the "Save & exit" button or anything of the simmilar to exit and save, Your pc should restart and then try opening lil baby again.
